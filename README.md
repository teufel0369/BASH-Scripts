# BASH-Scripts
Various Bash scripts I've written

proj1.sh is a BASH script that traverses a directory and outputs various information about the files in that directory.

cloneRepos.sh is a BASH script that will read in a list of git repos to clone, and execute the command for each repo. The addresses need to be on new lines, and you must be in the directory you wish to clone into before running.
